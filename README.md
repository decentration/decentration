We are pushing the envelope in Blockchain by working on an implementation of JAM. 

JAM is a new dynamically coherent decentralised computer that allows you to literally run turing complete computer programs on it. 

Given this new paradigm, what is now possible?

## What projects are we working on now
- The new [JAM](https://jam.web3.foundation) protocol client.

## What did we work on recently:
- **[Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io)**... a playground for building workflows and Dapps over blockchain infrastructure.

## Notable projects and achievments
- _2024/2023_: **[Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io)**... a playground for building workflows and Dapps over blockchain infrastructure.
- _2022/2021_: **[Parachain technical lead](https://gov.edgewa.re/discussion/2515-kabocha-technical-steward-proposal-referenda-funding)**: Saved millions of $$$ by Bootstrapping a Parachain. Over 18 months starting from 2021, I essentially bootstrapped a blockchain (parachain) with 1.5 FTE (full time employees) in a time when no less than millions of dollars of funding was spent to launch, build and maintain a parachain. ([Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain on the [Kusama](https://kusama.network) relay network).
- _2022_:      **PBA Graduate**: attended and qualified through the PBA ([Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.academy)), learning from blockchain pionners and wizards, like Gavin Wood over a 4 week period, in Cambridge, 2022. 

## Recap on what have we worked on prior to JAM...
- ⛓️ [Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io) => no-code playground for web3. 
- 🔭 key technical lead in the [Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain experiment on behalf of [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re)
- 🌱 working with [Substrate Blockchain Framework](https://substrate.dev) since December 2020.
- 👯 always looking for like minded contributors to explore how we can realise decentralised organisms for humanity.
