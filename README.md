Hi there, I'm Ramsey the founding steward of Decentration, we're building decentralised organisms and tools, which encompasses blockchain, AI, and cross pollinating research to explore new paradigms of technology. â›“ ðŸ‘‹

# What are we working on now
- We're currently working on Bagpipes, the place to build dapps with no-code... using an awesome drag and drop interface... Zapier is like a "Bagpipes for Web2" : P. This project is a startup that has received multiple grants and has engaged multiple communties, particularly Polkadot and substrate based chains... 

# What are we interested in?
- We're interesting in designing new computing infrastructure at the assembly level, from first principles. (This was prior to the [JAM Paper](https://graypaper.com), but now JAM has arrived as a protocol design we are thinking how we can contribute to realise coherent performant decentralised computing. 

- We're also interested in autonomous agents with decentralised values to produce novel decentralised organisms. Essentially blockchains that have autonomous agents powered by AI, LLMs (GPT). 

# What have worked on...
- ðŸ”­ We participated in the [Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain experiment on behalf of [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re)
- ðŸŒ± We've been working with [Substrate Blockchain Framework](https://substrate.dev) since December 2020.
- ðŸ‘¯ We're always looking for like minded contributors to explore how we can realise decentralised organisms for humanity.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask us about decentralised organisms, blockchains, and how to break old spells.
