### Hi there, I'm Ramsey the founding steward of Decentration, we're building decentralised tools for an open society on Web 3.0. We are focussing on building blockchain tools that will allow humans to to organise in better systems over the internet. ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Kabocha blockchain through Edgeware.](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Rust and Substrate and how to be an awesomely good open source contributor.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on decentralised tools that will enable wider and deeper use of Web 3.0.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building decentralised network and tooling. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about unstoppable decentralised organisations, blockchains, and how to break spells cast upon humanity.
