Hi there, I'm Ramsey the founding steward of Decentration. We're on a mission to build decentralised organisms, which encompasses building various paradigm technologies from first principles.

# What are we working on now
- The new JAM protocol client. 

# What are we interested in?
- designing new computing infrastructure at the assembly level, from first principles.
- thinking about the [JAM Protocol](https://graypaper.com), we are exploring how we can contribute to realise more coherent decentralised computing.
- Bagpipes, the place to build dapps with no-code... using an awesome drag and drop interface... Zapier is like a "Bagpipes for Web2" : P. This project is a startup that has received multiple grants and has engaged multiple communties, particularly Polkadot and substrate based chains...

- We're also interested in autonomous agents with decentralised values to produce novel decentralised organisms. Essentially blockchains that have autonomous agency.

# What have we worked on...
- ðŸ”­ participated in the [Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain experiment on behalf of [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re)
- ðŸŒ± working with [Substrate Blockchain Framework](https://substrate.dev) since December 2020.
- ðŸ‘¯ always looking for like minded contributors to explore how we can realise decentralised organisms for humanity.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask us about decentralised organisms, blockchains, and how to break old spells. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach us: element: @decentration:matrix.org, discord: "Ramsey (Decentration)#2804" email, ramsey@decentration.org
