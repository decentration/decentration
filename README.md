Hi there, I'm Ramsey the founding steward of Decentration, we're building decentralised organisms and tools, which encompasses blockchain, computer science, ML, and wider scientific research to steward new paradigms of technology. â›“ ðŸ‘‹

- We're currently working on autonomous agents with decentralised values to produce novel decentralised organisms. Essentially blockchains that have autonomous agents powered by AI, LLMs (GPT). 
- Recently, we've received grant funding through Web 3 foundation for [Supersig](https://github.com/kabocha-network/pallet_supersig).
- - We're also working on designing new computing infrastructure from the assembly level. 
- ðŸ”­ We participated in the [Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain experiment on behalf of [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re)
- ðŸŒ± We've been working with Substrate since December 2020.
- ðŸ‘¯ We're always looking for like minded contributors to collaborate on enabling decentralised organisms.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask us about decentralised organisms, blockchains, and how to break old spells. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach us: element: @decentration:matrix.org, discord: "Ramsey (Decentration)#2804" email, ramsey@decentration.org
