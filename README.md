We're on a journey to building decentralised organisms lead by Ramsey, lead architect of Decentration... This is involved the consubstantiation of blockhains and AI. 
With this paradigm unfolding of "thinking and reasoning" machines. things are getting weird pretty quickly. 
Our core value is to empower humans to leverage "brains in machines" (AI), and to retain ownership and sovereignty of it's output. 
There will be organisations of agentic AI, allocate resources and doing useful work over blockspace. 
It's important that we all have the opportunity for them to work for us.  

# What are we working on now
- The new [JAM](https://jam.web3.foundation) protocol client.

# What's coming soon...
- Orgs AI: build decentralised autonomous organisations of agents that work for humans. 

# Notable projects and achievments
- [Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io)... a playground for building workflows and Dapps over blockchain infrastructure.
- Bootstrapped Parachain: bootstrapped a blockchain (parachain) with 1.5 FTE (full time employees) in a time when only millions were spent in seed funds to build, lanch and maintain a parachain. ([Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/)  on [Kusama](https://kusama.network).
- PBA: attended and qualified through the PBA ([Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.academy)), learning from blockchain pionners and wizards, like Gavin Wood. 

# What are we interested in?
- designing new computing infrastructure at the assembly level, from first principles.
- thinking about (update: and now working on) the [JAM Protocol](https://graypaper.com), we are exploring how we can contribute to realise more coherent decentralised computing.
- [Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io), the place to build dapps with no-code... using an awesome drag and drop interface... Zapier is like a "Bagpipes for Web2" :P. This project is a startup that has received multiple grants and has engaged multiple communties, particularly Polkadot and substrate based chains...

# What have we worked on...
- ⛓️ [Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io) => no-code playground for web3. 
- 🔭 key technical lead in the [Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain experiment on behalf of [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re)
- 🌱 working with [Substrate Blockchain Framework](https://substrate.dev) since December 2020.
- 👯 always looking for like minded contributors to explore how we can realise decentralised organisms for humanity.
- 💬 Ask us about decentralised organisms, blockchains, and how to break old spells.
