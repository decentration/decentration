We're on a journey to building decentralised organisms lead by Ramsey, lead architect of Decentration... 
This involves the consubstantiation of blockhain and AI. 

As is becoming very apparent, a new paradigm is unfolding of "thinking and reasoning" machines. 
And things are getting weird pretty quickly!

A core value which embodies Decentration is to empower humans to leverage "brains in machines" (AI), 
and for humans to have the shared opportunity to retain ownership and sovereignty of it's output. 

There will be organisations of agentic AI that work to allocate resources and do useful work over blockchains. 
They will have the attributes that appear more like an organism than a program running on a machine. 

Components of the organism will have a shared objective function, they will have cognition and autonomy to make choice. 

It's important that we all have the opportunity for them to work for us.  

And there will be no better place for these cognitive organisms to leverage Polkadot's JAM [blockspace](https://polkadot.com/blockspace, which will essentially allow you to run fully fledged programs, with unbounded throughput. 

Making this generation of blockchain feel like a relic. 

## What projects are we working on now
- The new [JAM](https://jam.web3.foundation) protocol client.
- **[Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io)**... a playground for building workflows and Dapps over blockchain infrastructure.

## What's coming soon...
- Orgs AI: build decentralised autonomous organisations of agents that work for humans. 

## Notable projects and achievments
- _2024/2023_: **[Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io)**... a playground for building workflows and Dapps over blockchain infrastructure.
- _2022/2021_: **[Parachain technical lead](https://gov.edgewa.re/discussion/2515-kabocha-technical-steward-proposal-referenda-funding)**: Saved millions by Bootstrapping a Parachain. Over 18 months starting from 2021, I essentially bootstrapped a blockchain (parachain) with 1.5 FTE (full time employees) in a time when no less than millions of dollars of funding was spent to launch, build and maintain a parachain. ([Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain on the [Kusama](https://kusama.network) relay network).
- _2022_:      **PBA Graduate**: attended and qualified through the PBA ([Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.academy)), learning from blockchain pionners and wizards, like Gavin Wood over a 4 week period, in Cambridge, 2022. 

## What are we interested in?
- designing new computing infrastructure at the assembly level, from first principles.
- thinking about (update: and now working on) the [JAM Protocol](https://graypaper.com), we are exploring how we can contribute to realise more coherent decentralised computing.
- [Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io), the place to build dapps with no-code... using an awesome drag and drop interface... Zapier is like a "Bagpipes for Web2" :P. This project is a startup that has received multiple grants and has engaged multiple communties, particularly Polkadot and substrate based chains...

## Recap on what have we worked on...
- ⛓️ [Bagpipes](https://bagpipes.io) => no-code playground for web3. 
- 🔭 key technical lead in the [Kabocha](https://github.com/Kabocha-Network/) parachain experiment on behalf of [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re)
- 🌱 working with [Substrate Blockchain Framework](https://substrate.dev) since December 2020.
- 👯 always looking for like minded contributors to explore how we can realise decentralised organisms for humanity.
